# Bug Report and Remediation Plan

This document outlines the bugs identified in the Pinnacle Auto Finance portal, the fixes that have been implemented, and a plan for the remaining work.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Server Stability and Logging

*   **Issue:** The server was crashing due to a "Port already in use" error. This was caused by `nodemon` attempting to restart the server while a previous instance was still running. Additionally, the logs were not providing clear insights into the application's behavior.
*   **Fix:**
    *   I implemented a command to gracefully kill any existing server processes before restarting, ensuring a clean start.
    *   I enhanced the logging throughout the application to provide more detailed and structured information, making it easier to debug issues.

### 2. Broken Dashboard Functionality

*   **Issue:** The "Submit New Deal," "Logout," and "Deal Jacket" links on the dashboard were not functioning correctly.
*   **Fix:**
    *   **Routing:** I corrected the catch-all route in `server.js` to properly serve the static HTML pages, allowing for correct navigation between the dashboard, credit application, and other pages.
    *   **Missing File:** I created the `public/application-details.html` file, which was the missing target for the "Deal Jacket" links.
    *   **Data Handling:** I updated the JavaScript in `public/application-details.html` to correctly parse the JSON response from the server, ensuring that the application details are displayed correctly.
    *   **Logout Functionality:** I improved the `logout()` function in `public/dashboard.html` to clear both local and session storage, ensuring a complete and secure logout.

## Newly Created Files

*   **`public/application-details.html`:** This file serves as the "Deal Jacket" page, displaying the details of a single credit application. It fetches data from the `/api/applications/:applicationId` endpoint and renders the information in a user-friendly format.

## Next Steps: Plan for Remaining Work

1.  **Implement Full "Deal Jacket" Functionality:** The `application-details.html` page is currently a placeholder. The next step is to fully implement the "Deal Jacket" functionality, including:
    *   Displaying all relevant application data.
    *   Adding the ability to add and view conversation notes.
    *   Integrating with the GHL and DealerTrack APIs to provide a comprehensive view of the application's status.
2.  **Enhance the Credit Application Form:** The credit application form needs to be improved to include all necessary fields and validation. This includes:
    *   Adding fields for co-borrowers, trade-in information, and other required data.
    *   Implementing client-side and server-side validation to ensure data integrity.
3.  **Complete GHL and DealerTrack Integration:** The GHL and DealerTrack integrations are currently placeholders. The next steps are to:
    *   Implement the full GHL API integration to create and update contacts and opportunities.
    *   Implement the DealerTrack API integration to submit credit applications and retrieve status updates.
4.  **Refine User Interface and Experience:** The overall user interface and experience can be improved by:
    *   Adding more interactive elements to the dashboard.
    *   Improving the layout and design of the credit application form.
    *   Providing more detailed and user-friendly error messages.
